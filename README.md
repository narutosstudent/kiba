A Mini Netflix clone built with Solid.js, Astro and deployed on Netlify. :smile:

I'm using Directus as a headless CMS here, though, I'm using the free version, so the site may not be available for everyone after people have visited it.

I couldn't upload the original demo video with sound because it is too big. :skull:

Regardless, here is the muted and speeded up version. :fire:
